# About "Add  event to a calendar" repository

This repository contains community-driven documents that describe how to add events 
to different online calendar services that usually don't have official 
documentation/specs.

The primary goal of this repository is to consolidate the efforts of 
developers to debugging/reverse-engineering calendar services to find 
possible parameters and features that we can use in our products.

Usually, 3rd party services doesn’t privide verbose documentation on how to create
calendar events using GET parameters. The main goal to find available options — reverse-engineering.
